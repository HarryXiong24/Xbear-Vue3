# Typescript-Webpack-Start

## Description

A template for quickly developing projects with Typescript and Webpack.

## Usage

```bash
# Clone it from Github.
$ git clone https://github.com/HarryXiong24/typescript-webpack-start.git
$ cd typescript-webpack-start
```

```bash
# If you want to use yarn.
yarn install
yarn dev
yarn build
```

```bash
# If you want to use npm.
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

### Hint

The simple example is located in the examples folder, so the packaging file entry set by Webpack is located in index.ts under the examples folder.

The file in the directory under src is just an empty file. Please modify it yourself according to your needs.
